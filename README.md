## üèÜ The Challenge

Build a two-wheeled robot that dares to defy gravity. The moment it powers on, it has one mission: fight to stay upright. Every fraction of a second becomes a high-speed feedback loop of sensing, calculating, and adjusting.

But real success isn't about balancing in perfect conditions‚Äîit's about resilience. Your bot must recover from a push, absorb a bump, and adapt instantly when its load changes.

### The Final Test
Picture carefully placing a full cup of coffee on top of your robot. If it can hold steady‚Äîwithout spilling a drop‚Äîyou've achieved victory.

## üìä Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features
- [x] MPU6050 sensor initialization and calibration
- [x] Complementary filter for angle calculation
- [x] Basic PID controller framework
- [x] Stepper motor control interface
- [x] Serial debugging output

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Improvements Needed
1. **Motor Control**: Current implementation sends single pulses instead of continuous pulse trains
2. **Timing**: Blocking delays interfere with control loop consistency
3. **PID Tuning**: Default values need optimization for specific hardware
4. **Direction Logic**: May need reversal based on mechanical setup

---

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Assembly
1. **Mount IMU sensor** on the chassis (ensure proper orientation - Y-axis along pitch)
2. **Install NEMA17 stepper motors** with proper mechanical coupling to wheels
3. **Configure TB6600 drivers**: Set current limit and microstep resolution via DIP switches
4. **Wire according to pin configuration** above - pay attention to common ground
5. **Mount 12V battery pack** with easy access for charging
6. **Balance mechanical design**: Ensure center of mass is above wheel axle
7. **Test all connections** before powering on - verify voltage levels

### 2. Software Installation
1. Install Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
2. Install ESP32 board package
3. Install required libraries:
   - `MPU6050` library by Electronic Cats
   - `Wire` library (built-in)
4. Configure TB6600 drivers (current setting and microstep resolution)
5. Upload the code to ESP32
6. Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)

### 3. Calibration Process
1. **Power on sequence**: TB6600 drivers first, then ESP32
2. Place robot on **perfectly flat surface**
3. Keep IMU **completely still** during startup calibration
4. Wait for "Gyro Offsets" message in serial output
5. Robot is now ready for balance testing
6. **Safety**: Have manual power cutoff ready during testing

## üéõÔ∏è PID Tuning Guide

### Initial Settings (Current)
```cpp
float Kp = 1.0;   // Proportional gain
float Ki = 0.0;   // Integral gain  
float Kd = 0.0;   // Derivative gain
```

### Recommended Tuning Process
1. **Start with P-only**: Set `Kp = 15`, others to 0
2. **Test oscillation**: Robot should swing around balance point
3. **Add D control**: Gradually increase `Kd` (try 0.5, 1.0, 2.0) to reduce oscillations
4. **Add I control**: Only if steady-state error exists (try 0.1, 0.5)

### Tuning Tips
- **Too much P**: Fast oscillations, unstable
- **Too little P**: Slow response, falls over
- **Too much D**: Jittery, high-frequency noise
- **Too much I**: Overshooting, slow settling

## üêõ Debugging

### Serial Monitor Output
The code outputs real-time debugging information:
- **Error**: Difference between target and current angle
- **Angle**: Current tilt angle from accelerometer
- **PID Value**: Controller output
- **Speed**: Mapped motor speed value

### Common Issues
1. **Robot falls immediately**: 
   - Check PID gains, increase Kp
   - Verify TB6600 current settings for NEMA17
   - Ensure 12V power supply is adequate
2. **Continuous oscillation**: 
   - Reduce Kp or increase Kd
   - Check mechanical backlash in wheel coupling
3. **Slow response**: 
   - Increase Kp
   - Verify TB6600 microstep settings (lower = faster)
4. **Wrong direction**: 
   - Check motor wiring sequence (A+, A-, B+, B-)
   - Verify DIR pin logic in code
5. **Sensor drift**: 
   - Recalibrate gyroscope offsets
   - Check MPU6050 mounting and vibrations
6. **Motor stuttering**:
   - Check TB6600 power connections
   - Verify common ground between ESP32 and drivers
   - Ensure adequate 12V current supply
